# The Cart algorithm (Decision Tree Classifier)

Decision trees is one of the most powerful machine learning algorithmes today, although its simplicity. it has many implementations. one of it is the **CART (Classification and Regression Tree)** algorithm.

In this project we will:

-   Implement its whole class (ready to import and use) for classification from scratch, with its main methods (fit, predict, accuracy_score, predict proba, print_tree).

-   Test the algorithme on a simple dataset to see if it works coorrectly.

all of that using just **numpy** and **pandas** built-in functions!

I hope you find this project useful and helpful. if you have any question or suggestion, please let me know in the issues section. Enjoy! üòä

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** this implementation is based on the **CART** algorithme main idea, but it is **totaly my own implementation**. So you can find a totaly different implementation in another place.
